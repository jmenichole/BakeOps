# Deployment Completion Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed project structure and deployment requirements
- [x] Fix Tailwind CSS v4 configuration (updated globals.css to use v4 syntax)

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Update root vercel.json to include backend API routes
- [x] Create .env.example for frontend (app/)
- [x] Create .env.example for backend
- [x] Verify all deployment configurations are correct

## Notes
- Project is a monorepo with "app" (Next.js) and "backend" (Vercel serverless functions)
- Uses Supabase for authentication and database
- Tailwind v4 now uses CSS-based configuration (@theme directive)
